This section provides an overview of the tools, libraries, and technologies utilized to build the Habit Tracking App. Each tool plays a critical role in achieving the app's functionality, from interacting with external APIs to automating habit tracking.

---

#### **1. Pixela API**
   - **Description**: A lightweight and user-friendly API for creating visual habit-tracking graphs. It allows users to log daily progress, update habits, and visualize data on a web interface.
   - **Usage in App**:
     - Creating user accounts and setting up a habit graph.
     - Logging daily habits and updating or deleting records programmatically.
     - Visualizing habit tracking data.

---

#### **2. Python `requests` Library**
   - **Description**: A simple and powerful library to handle HTTP requests in Python.
   - **Usage in App**:
     - Performing `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests to interact with the Pixela API.
     - Sending data payloads (e.g., JSON) and handling responses from the server.

---

#### **3. Python `datetime` Module**
   - **Description**: A built-in Python module for working with dates and times.
   - **Usage in App**:
     - Fetching the current date dynamically for habit logging.
     - Formatting the date to match the API’s requirements (e.g., `YYYYMMDD` format).

---

#### **4. Environment Variables (`os` Module)**  
   - **Description**: Python’s `os` module allows access to operating system-level functionality, including environment variables.  
   - **Usage in App**:
     - Securely storing and retrieving sensitive information, such as the Pixela API token and username.
     - Avoiding hardcoding sensitive credentials in the source code for better security.

---

#### **5. Version Control with Git and GitHub**  
   - **Description**: Tools for source code management and collaboration.  
   - **Usage in App**:
     - Maintaining project versions, branches, and collaboration through pull requests.
     - Hosting the repository on GitHub for distributed team contributions.

---

#### **6. Python `json` Module**  
   - **Description**: A module to parse, create, and manipulate JSON data.  
   - **Usage in App**:
     - Preparing data payloads for API requests in the required JSON format.
     - Parsing API responses for logging and debugging.

---

#### **7. Python `os` Module**  
   - **Description**: Provides functionality to interact with the operating system.  
   - **Usage in App**:
     - Handling environment variables securely to manage sensitive credentials.

---

#### **8. Error Handling and Logging**  
   - **Description**: Python’s built-in exception-handling mechanisms ensure the app remains robust.  
   - **Usage in App**:
     - Detecting and addressing API request failures.
     - Logging potential issues, such as network connectivity errors or invalid API tokens.
